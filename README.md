## Style
Apart from the intro page that intends to be appealing, the aim for the rest of the site is to keep a **minimal and functional design** focused on information, avoiding any additional element that could distract users’ attention. For that purpose it has been used a business-like, sober and subtle style, keeping simplicity at all times.  

## Features
